Run this homebrew once with HENkaku installed and hijack the email application to install HENkaku again the next reboot--no internet needed.

To install or update HENkaku offline:

1. First, install and activate HENkaku from {{ site.url }}
2. Download the [Offline Installer VPK](https://github.com/henkaku/offline-installer/releases/latest) and install it
3. Make sure unsafe homebrew is allowed (molecularShell->press Start button->Enable unsafe homebrew->on)
4. Launch the offlineInstaller bubble
5. Follow the instructions: press CROSS to install
6. (Do not delete the bubble after the exploit is installed. You should redo the installation when you have internet access to ensure that you get the latest version of HENkaku)

To run HENkaku offline:

1. Reboot your PS Vita
2. Disable Wi-Fi
3. Open Email app. If at some point it asks you to enable wifi, press "No". If you have wifi switched on, the message list will not load.
4. If you have multiple email accounts, select "HENkaku Offline"
5. Select "Inbox", then click on the first email
6. Wait about 10-20 seconds. You might get a "Please wait" screen multiple times. You might also get an "An error has occurred" screen multiple times. If you get any of these more than five times in a row, reboot your Vita and try again.
7. You should see the same screen as with online installation (black screen with text and molecule logo)

To uninstall HENkaku offline:

1. Launch offlineInstaller
2. Press CIRCLE to uninstall
